Technical Documentation is not just what I do, it's how I live. I have spent most of my life documenting everything from quick start guides to APIs. 
Open Source, Linux, and Git are my tools of the trade. I work in a Docs as Code Philosophy and teach what I know to anyone willing to listen.  
With me you get a seasoned technical writer, a team player, and a leader. I coach, mentor, and assist new technical writers.
