## About
Hi there! I'm Liat.
I write, so you can read less and do more.
I’m a technical writer based in Israel. My background as an information specialist helps me distill long and complex information into a digestable text. I like exploring new technologies, tools, and programming languages. Other than that, I like chubby cats, gourmet pastries, and exercising in slow motion.

## Skills
My strongest skill is learning new skills!
Right now I'm into:
* GitHub
* Markdown
* Hugo
* HTML
* CSS

## Experience
The past is in the past, the future is yet to come and the present is a present.
