# POC - General Putnam Motel Diner API 

The General Putnam Motel Diner API POC illustrates two basic functions required for the Diner's operations, which will be two of many met by the API:
* Order placement
* Process of Bill

The API will allow patrons to place an order for takeout, and ultimately, digitially via a tablet while seated in the Diner.

The API will allow staff to provide patrons with a bill for payment due.
