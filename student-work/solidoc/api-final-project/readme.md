# POC - General Putnam Motel Diner API 

The General Putnam Motel Diner API POC illustrates two of many basic functions required for the Diner's operations:

* Take-out Order placement
* Bill Processing

The API will allow patrons to place a takeout order and get the bill. 

The API may be further developed to include features such digital orders for in-house patrons.
