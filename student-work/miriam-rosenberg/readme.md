## About

First and foremost, I love it when things work simply and elegantly. It gives me great pleasure to solve problems, increase usability, and make the process smooth from the beginning to the end.
I've always been practical, and ever since I was little, I have been fascinated with technology and gadgets. I liked when toys worked, and once I even fixed the knee of my Barbie doll with a fork. 
Very early on, I realised that things only work when information and communication work hand in hand. In my search for the best methods of communication, I developed a passion for languages. As a result, I am always learning one. So far, I have mastered three: Polish, English, and Spanish.

Knowing a language is not enough; you need to know how to use it. So I took up the opportunity to learn it through a Technical Writing course. 
It opened my eyes wider than I expected and challenged my intellect. 
Here is what I learned: 
1. The success of your product depends on the users knowing how to use it. 
2. I step in to help with point 1. 
3. The result is concise and straightforward documentation, an online Help system, or a User Guide.

The best part of being a Technical Writer is that the intellectual journey never ends.
