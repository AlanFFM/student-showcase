Hello! I am Felice Berk. Welcome to my repository on GitHub! 

I have spent most of my life writing anything from poems, to short stories, to chapter books for children.
When it came time to pivot careers, Technical Writing seemed only natural.
I have acquired a new appreciation for the written word, with its infinite applications.   

As a new Technical Writer, you will gain from me a fresh perspective along with the knowledge and creativity you would expect from a more seasoned Technical Writer.
