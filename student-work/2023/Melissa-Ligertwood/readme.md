### About
>Proud mom to two rescue pups. Storyteller, extroverted introvert, and reformed martini enthusiast. Never passes up a David Ridgen podcast or Netflix documentary. Wannabe chef. Aspiring non fiction author. Lover of words and notorious slayer of run-on sentences.

I am a versatile and adaptable mid-career professional with a background in technical writing, stakeholder relations, and program coordination. I thrive in goal-oriented, productive environments where team members can get the job done while also supporting and respecting each other.

My fascination with humans led me to a degree in psychology, and I spent the first part of my career in psychology testing and assessment. I bring early career experience in psychometrics, statistical analysis, and questionnaire design. 

When I left psychology, I spent five years in administrative roles while building a freelance writing portfolio on the side. Today, I'm a successful technical writer and consultant with a broad range of projects under my belt, including websites and marketing materials for small business, cybersecurity documentation in the oil and gas industry, and Indigenous community development. I am a skilled researcher and interviewer who approaches each task with an analytical, critical eye. 

Most recently, I completed four documentation projects as a technical writer and business analyst with Parkland Corporation’s IT infrastructure/operations and cybersecurity teams. In these roles, I worked both independently and collaboratively to develop documentation requirements, facilitate discussion with subject matter experts, and support leaders in moving their projects forward. At Parkland, my supervisors often commented on the quality of my work and my willingness to take on new challenges.
 
I also recently upskilled into user experience research and design, and I am currently leading a passion project with a few of my bootcamp colleagues. I am fascinated by design thinking and anxious to apply my skills in a solutioning environment. 

I would love to meet with your team in person to chat more about working together. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
