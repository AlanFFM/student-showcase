## Experience Summary
I have been in technical communications for more than 30 years with more than 22 years at **IBM UK Ltd** as a technical sales specialist, latterly in the area of Data and AI. This role primarily comprised presenting IBMâ€™s wide range of data products to technical and business audiences of prospective customers and business partners in both oral and written forms. In terms of technical communications these included:
* Design and preparation of tailored presentations
* Pre-Tender Preliminary Questionnaires (PPQs)
* Requests for Proposal (RFPs)
* Formal responses to Invitations to Tender (ITTs)

I have experience with various document editing and composition tools including 
* _Adobe FrameMaker_
  * Used for the authoring of an IBM Redbook, see below
* _RoboHelp_
* _Madcap Flare_
* _Ventura Publisher_

I am a published author having co-authored the IBM Redbook (the definitive "how to" guide) on [IBMâ€™s unstructured text _Classification Module_](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg247707.pdf)

While living in Israel earlier in my career, I worked as a technical writer for **Fibronics** (fiber-optic telecommunications equipment) and then **Telrad** (public and private telephone exchange equipment), before running my own technical writing company, ___The Last Word___. In that capacity I provided technical writing services for a number of companies (including **Telrad**) and aslo acted as consulting SME for a then new daiy newspaper - ___The Nation___. I implemented Ventura Publisher in all departments and was able to produce a daily tabloid as well as a weekend magazine. I returned to the UK shortly thereafter for personal reasons.

I left IBM at the end of June 2023 and am currently living in Bet Shemesh. I am looking for a position as a technical writer in the hi-tech sector where I can use my considerable range of skills and experience. My mother-tongue is English and my conversational Ivrit is fluent.
