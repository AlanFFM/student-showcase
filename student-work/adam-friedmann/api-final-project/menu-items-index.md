# Menu Items Index

This index contains a list of all the items on the Putnam Diner menu that can be ordered using the app. Each menu item is represented in the app by a meal
object that contains several smaller meal component objects. Meal objects define which components are included in a meal, as well the limits of the numbers
and sizes of the meal components.
